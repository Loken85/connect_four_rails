# Ruby on Rails Implementation of Connect Four

This is a version of Connect Four implemented inside the Ruby on Rails framework for web based play. This is a work in Progress.

Notes on Functionality:
			This app will allow you to play games of Connect Four between two player. 
			Players need to create an account, and sign in to the site before they can play. 
			Game play is avaialble from both the home page and profile page once players are signed in.
			
			Features:   2-player game play with semi-real time updates
						High-scores chart for players (Not yet implemented)
						Win-loss ratio for players (Not yet implemented)
						Game invites (Not yet implemented)
						Multiple games (Not yet implemented)
						
			Why are so many features not implemented yet? This project has been developed in a very short period of time, and much work remains
			to implement all the desired features. 
			As a result, there is some code which is not currentl in use, or will serve alternate purposes as the project continues. 
			
			The site is not strictly RESTful, there are some instances of departure from this model which should be corrected with refactoring.
			The site does not 100% follow rails MVC separation, this too should be corrected with refactoring given time. 
			The CSS/html styling elements are a bit of a mish-mash currently, and need improvement, once again dependant on time. 
			Performance and visuals are not 100% on older versions of Internet Explorer. Best viewed in Chrome or Firefox.
